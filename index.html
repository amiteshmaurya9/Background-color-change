    The story of the Internet begins with ARPANET, a project funded by the
    US Department of Defense in the late 1960s. Developed by a team of
    researchers led by Paul Barron and Donald Davies, ARPANET was the first
    network to use packet switching technology, a method of data
    transmission that breaks information into smaller packets for more .
    This would enable small groups of data to be sent along differing paths
    to the destination.This idea eventually became packet communication that
    underlies almost all data communication today. ARPANET linked computers
    at different research institutions and allowed researchers to share data
    over long distances. This innovation laid the foundation for the
    Internet as we know it today.
